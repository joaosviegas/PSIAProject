# PSIA — AI Movie Recommendation Hub (group 37)

Microservices app for the Platforms for AI Systems project: register, build a movie profile, browse other users,
ask an LLM for recommendations, and get a feed pre-computed by a background agent.


## Prerequisites

- **Docker** (Desktop on macOS/Windows with >= 8 GB memory; on Windows use WSL2)
- **[just](https://github.com/casey/just)** — command runner (like make but simpler)
- **git**, **curl**, **jq** — used by `scripts/smoke.sh`
- **Node.js 22** — only needed for `npm run dev` (hot-reload frontend dev); production builds happen in Docker

A JDK is **not** required. Maven builds run inside Docker containers.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone <repo-url> && cd proj-agi
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: change every password and set JWT_SECRET to a random 32+ char string.

# 2. Start everything
just start          # builds all images and pulls the LLM model (~1 GB, first run only)
just ps             # wait until every service shows "healthy"

# 3. Open the app
open http://localhost:8080    # or just visit it in a browser

# 4. Verify
just smoke          # runs end-to-end checks through the gateway
```

## Day-to-day commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `just start` | Build images, start all containers |
| `just stop` | Stop containers (data volumes kept) |
| `just ps` | Container status and health |
| `just restart <service>` | Rebuild and restart one service, e.g. `just restart auth-service` |
| `just logs <service>` | Follow logs (omit service for all) |
| `just smoke` | End-to-end test through the gateway |
| `just test <service>` | Run Maven tests in Docker, e.g. `just test auth-service` |
| `just psql auth` | Open psql on a service's database |
| `just redis` | Open redis-cli |
| `just clean` | Stop and delete Postgres + Redis data (keeps LLM model) |
| `just nuke` | Stop and delete everything including the LLM model |

## Frontend development

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev    # Vite dev server with hot reload, proxies /api to localhost:8080
```

Requires the backend to be running (`just start`).

## Services

| Service | Path via gateway | Store |
|---|---|---|
| gateway (nginx + Vue) | `/` | — |
| auth-service | `/api/auth/*` | Postgres db `auth` |
| profile-service | `/api/profiles/*` | Postgres db `profile` |
| recommendation-service | `/api/movies/*`, `/api/recommendations` | Postgres db `movies` + Ollama |
| agent-service | `/api/feed/*` | Redis + Ollama |
| llm (Ollama) | internal | model volume |
